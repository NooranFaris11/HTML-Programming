   <h2>
   How many programming languages are there?
   </h2>
   <p>
   As computers have evolved, many different computer programming languages created for various types of development.<br> Although we do have several dozen languages listed on our site, there are hundreds that we don't have listed. To get an idea of the different programming languages, you can visit The Hello World Collection, which gives a demo of how to write "Hello World" in over 591 different programming languages.

   <h2>
   What are the top programming languages?
   
   </h2>
   <p>
   There are many ways this question could be answered. However, we feel the best method is to rely on the data from <a href =" https://github.com/">GitHub,</a> <br>
   a service that hosts over 96 million software projects. In the chart below, GitHub shows the top 10 programming languages from 2014 to 2018.
