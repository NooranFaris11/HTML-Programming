   <p>
  All desktop applications can easily be developed in Java. Java also provides GUI development capability through various means mainly Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT), Swing and JavaFX. While AWT holds a number of pre-assembled components like menu, list, button. Swing is a GUI widget toolkit, it provides certain advanced elements like trees, scroll panes, tables, tabbed panel, and lists.

Java is also used to develop web applications. It provides a vast support for web applications through Servlets, Struts or JSPs. With the help of these technologies, you can develop any kind of web application that you require. The easy coding and high security offered by this programming language allow the development of a large number of applications for health, social security, education, and insurance.Java is the first choice of many software developers for writing applications and Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a very popular platform that provides API and runtime environment for scripting. It also includes network applications and web-services. JavaEE is also considered as the backbone for a variety of banking applications which have Java running on the UI to back server end.Java has the support of the open-source most powerful 3D-Engine, the jMonkeyEngine that has the unparalleled capability when it comes to the designing of 3D games. However, it does cause an occasional latency issue for games as garbage collection cycles can cause noticeable pauses. This issue will be solved in the newer versions of JVMs.Java is the reason why the leading Big Data technologies like Hadoop have become a reality and also the most powerful programming languages like Scala are existing. It is crystal clear that Java is the backbone when it comes to developing Big Data using Java.
